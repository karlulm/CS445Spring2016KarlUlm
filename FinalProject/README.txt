Final Project

Requirements/steps  needed to run application:

        Install Tomcat v8.0 Server

        You will also need Maven because that is what used to build my project

        I would also Suggest install chrome web browser, because there is a fantastic plug in called Postman. That lets you send and receive REST commands.
        
        TO reach all of my REST commands you will need to http://localhost:8080/delectable/webapi/ and then enter in the command you wish to access.
        It is set up like this because I used a plug in called Jersey that helped me build my REST API.
        Here is a link to Jersey's Website: https://jersey.java.net/
        Also  While running the REST API you may have to enter a Header and value.
        The values to plug in here are Header: Content-Type  and Value application/json
